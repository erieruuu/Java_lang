INTRODUCTION TO JAVA - CodeAcademy

- Java programs have at least one class and one main() method.

- Each class represents one real-world idea.

- The main() method runs the tasks of the program.

- Java comments add helpful context to human readers.

- Java has whitespace, curly braces, and semicolons.

- Whitespace is for humans to read code easily.

- Curly braces mark the scope of a class and method.

- Semicolons mark the end of a statement.

- Java is a compiled language.

- Compiling catches mistakes in our code.

- Compilers transform code into an executable class.

e.g:
---------------------------------------------------------
Review.java
public class Review {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // The main method executes the tasks of the class
    System.out.println("My first Java program from scratch!");
  }
}
